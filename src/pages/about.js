                    I am a full stack web developer with a background 
                    as an architect and draftsman. In moving to New 
                    Zealand I have gained experience in technical 
                    advisory roles within local government district 
                    planning, as well as freelance web development, 
                    hospitality and airline staffing.<br></br><br></br>
                    With strength in front end development, I enjoy working 
                    with customers developing websites and functional apps 
                    which deliver on their business needs and 
                    objectives. With my design background and prior 
                    experience in web development I have a keen eye 
                    for both aesthetics and functionality.<br></br><br></br>
                    Other people describe me as a perceptive, genuine and 
                    honest person 
                    who presents with clear and open communication, 
                    as someone who works with focus and deep attention 
                    to detail, as a capable independent worked and someone 
                     possesses a can do and willing attitude. In team 
                     projects I have been acknowledged as a stand out 
                     member, as someone who is calm and thinks well under 
                     pressure, and as a particularly supportive, helpful 
                     and caring person.<br></br><br></br>
                     Loyal and with a solid work ethic, I am methodical 
                     and enjoy solving problems, making things work and 
                     I derive energy from progressive 
                     achievements and moving projects forward, I have a 
                     tendency to tackle things head on and am willing in 
                     my approach to do whatever needs to be done. I am 
                     passionate about contributing to practical websites 
                     and application that are useful and beneficial to 
                     users, particular where these improve their lives. 
                     My current career interests are in progressing to 
                     lead a development team and longer term in product 
                     ownership. I would also like to develop more skills 
                     working with graphics, animation and robotics.</p>
